### TiDE

In April 2023, researchers at Google proposed TiDE: a **long-term forecasting model** with an encoder-decoder architecture built with Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs).

In their paper [Long-term Forecasting with TiDE: Time-series Dense Encoder](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.08424.pdf), the authors demonstrate that the model achieves state-of-the-art results on numerous datasets when compared to other Transformer-based and MLP-based models, like PatchTST and N-HiTS respectively.
